# Image Classifier

Before working on this image classifier, I had only used PHP for web development, so I wanted to learn a more modern technology. I chose the MERN stack because it was the first thing that was suggested to me. I didn't finish this, so many of the features that seem to be there either aren't implemented or aren't working.

## Getting Started

This is pretty easy to set up, so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to get running.

### Prerequisites

   - [Node JS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

  1.) Navigate to the root directory containing the following folders
  
    /client
    /server
    
  2.) Open two command prompts, one within the client folder and one within the server folder and execute the following command within each:
  
    npm install
    [If npm install doesn't work, use the following command]
    npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps
  
  3.) Once the npm packages are done installing in both, execute either of the following commands within the server command prompt:
  
    nodemon index.js
    -or-
    node index.js
    
  4.) Then execute the following command within the client command prompt:
  
    npm run start
    
  5.) A browser window should open after step 4 and the app will be up and running at this point
